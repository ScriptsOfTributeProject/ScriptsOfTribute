Scripts of Tribute
Implementation of Tales of Tribute card game simulator for AI competition.

## Tales of Tribute
More info about the game itself is available at [eso-hub.com](https://eso-hub.com/en/tales-of-tribute-card-game). SoT was created for patch 8.1.5 and this is the only supported version at the moment.

## Project structure
* **`Engine`**, is the core of the engine. All the functions needed for simulations are here (mostly in the `ScriptsOfTributeAPI` class).
* **`GameRunner`**, is a CLI game runner with referee, game stats, etc. It comes with some tools useful for debbuging as well as a multithreaded or fixed game seed modes. Use `--help`/`-h` flag to get all information.
* **`Bots`**, is a set of a couple example AIs created by us.
* **`BotTests`** and **`Tests`**, contain the tests for the bots and the engine respectively.
* **`ScriptsOfTributeUI`** ([repo](https://github.com/ScriptsOfTribute/ScriptsOfTribute-GUI)), is a GUI app created with Unity3D framework. It is a tool that allows user to play with AIs created on this engine. Introduces many tools to debug and improve bots.


## External Language Adapter Docs
Here is the description and breakdown of the JSON file which is being sent to external (different language than C#) bots.
First let's list basic objects which are being used to build whole JSON input:
* *PatronStates*:
  * It's JSON object where keys are Patron's names in stringified [PatronId](https://github.com/ScriptsOfTribute/ScriptsOfTribute-Core/blob/c92f394483a9b2ba2fff0a52194bace6a4b7114d/Engine/src/Patrons/Patron.cs#L5) format, for example "ANSEI", "DUKE_OF_CROWS". Values are stringified [PlayerEnum](https://github.com/ScriptsOfTribute/ScriptsOfTribute-Core/blob/c92f394483a9b2ba2fff0a52194bace6a4b7114d/Engine/src/Board/Player.cs#L6) values suggesting which Player is favored by certain Patron.
  * Object contains 4 key-value pairs like that, only for Patrons picked for current game.
* *Effects*:
  * We describe effects here because they are used for serialization of *Cards* below.
  * Effect is just a *string* but may contain 3 formats depending on type: Normal effect, Composite of effects and Alternative of effects
  * Normal effect is just a string in format: "{Type} {Amount}"
  * Composite of effects is a string in format: "{Type} {Amount} AND {Type} {Amount}"
  * Alternative of effects is a string in format: {Type} {Amount} OR {Type} {Amount}"
  * *Type* is stringified [EffectType](https://github.com/ScriptsOfTribute/ScriptsOfTribute-Core/blob/c92f394483a9b2ba2fff0a52194bace6a4b7114d/Engine/src/Board/Cards/UniqueEffect.cs#L3), *Amount* is a number
* *Cards*:
  * Basic object representing card
  * This object contains few fields with basic types:
    * `"name"` - representing name of the card, known from the Tales of Tribute game. **Type**: *string*
    * `"deck"` - representing name of the deck this card belongs to. **Type**: *string*
    * `"type"` - Type of this card, one of the [CardType](https://github.com/ScriptsOfTribute/ScriptsOfTribute-Core/blob/c92f394483a9b2ba2fff0a52194bace6a4b7114d/Engine/src/Board/Cards/Card.cs#L3) values, obviosly stringified. **Type**: *string*
    * `"HP"` - Health status of the card, Non-agent cards have -1 value in this field. **Type**: *int*
    * `"taunt"` - boolean field that can be True only for Agent-type cards. **Type**: *bool*
    * `"UniqueId"` - unique identifier for this **instance** of card in engine's database. **Type**: *int*
    * `"effects"` - list of *Effect* objects. Index is corresponding to the Combo type of the card, more precisely:
      * 0th index corresponds to "On activation"
      * 1st index corresponds to "Combo 2"
      * 2nd index and 3rd analogically to "Combo 3" and "Combo 4"
  * Examples can be found in [tests](Tests/utils/JSONSerializeTests.cs)
* *Agent*:
  * Contains 3 keys:
    * `"CurrentHP"` - current health of this agent. **Type**: *int*
    * `"Card"` - *Card* object representing this Agent. **Type**: *Card*
    * `"Activated"` - was this agent activated in this round. **Type**": *bool*
* *Choice*:
  * Describes currently pending choise player has to handle. Contains 6 keys:
    * `"MaxChoices"` - maximum number of picks player can make in current choice. **Type**: *int*
    * `"MinChoices"` - minimum number of picks player has to make in current choice. **Type**: *int*
    * `"Context"` - value that informs player what exactly enacted this choice. It can be Patron, Effect or another Choice. **Type**: *string*
    * `"ChoiceFollowUp"` - stringified [ChoiceFollowUp](https://github.com/ScriptsOfTribute/ScriptsOfTribute-Core/blob/c92f394483a9b2ba2fff0a52194bace6a4b7114d/Engine/src/Board/PlayResult.cs#L15C13-L15C27) explaining what happens next.
    * `"Type"` - saying either "CARD" or "EFFECTS" explaining what type of objects is now being chosen. **Type**: *string*
    * Now depending on "Type" value we can have two different keys:
      * `"PossibleCards"` - list of possible *Cards* to choose from
      * `"PossibleEffects"` - list of possible *Effects* to choose from
* *CurrentPlayer*:
  * JSON object describing player with following keys:
    * `"Player"` - stringified [PlayerEnum](https://github.com/ScriptsOfTribute/ScriptsOfTribute-Core/blob/c92f394483a9b2ba2fff0a52194bace6a4b7114d/Engine/src/Board/Player.cs#L6). Identified of player for this game.
    * `"Hand"` - array of *Cards* that are in Player's hand right now.
    * `"Cooldown"` - array of *Cards* that are in Player's cooldown pile right now.
    * `"Played"` - array of *Cards* that are in Player's played pile right now.
    * `"KnownPile"` -  - array of *Cards* from player's draw pile that Player has knowledge about their order.
    * `"Agents"` - array of *Agent* cards currently on the board.

* *EnemyPlayer*:
  * Similar to *CurrentPlayer* with some small differences.
    * `"Player"` - stringified [PlayerEnum](https://github.com/ScriptsOfTribute/ScriptsOfTribute-Core/blob/c92f394483a9b2ba2fff0a52194bace6a4b7114d/Engine/src/Board/Player.cs#L6). Identified of player for this game.
    * `"HandAndDraw"` - array of *Cards* that are in Enemy's hand and draw pile right now. We do this since our Bot doesn't know what cards will enemy have in his hand in the next turn.
    * `"Cooldown"` - array of *Cards* that are in Enemy's cooldown pile right now.
    * `"Played"` - array of *Cards* that are in Enemy's played pile right now.
    * `"Agents"` - array of *Agent* cards currently on the board on Enemy side.
    * `"Power"` - amount of power Enemy has. **Type**: *int*
    * `"Coins"` - amount of coin Enemy has. **Type**: *int*
    * `"Prestige"` - amount of prestige Enemy has. **Type**: *int*
   
* *CompletedAction*
  * That's a simple string that explains every action that happened in history of the game. I'm not gonna explain every possible output here, please check [this](Engine/src/Board/CompletedAction.cs) file and CompletedAction's method `ToSimpleString()`.

Now we can build our JSON object that will describe GameState. That's the object which engine sends to external bots.
Root object contains following keys:
* `"PatronStates"` - *PatronState* object
* `"TavernAvailableCards"` - array of *Cards* which are available in the tavern to buy.
* `"BoardState"` - stringified [BoardState](https://github.com/ScriptsOfTribute/ScriptsOfTribute-Core/blob/c92f394483a9b2ba2fff0a52194bace6a4b7114d/Engine/src/Board/CardAction/CardActionManager.cs#L6) enum. It explains in what state board is currently in.
* `"UpcomingEffects"` - array of *Effects* which are about to be enacted.
* `"StartOfNextTurnEffects"` - array of *Effects* to be enacted on the start of the next turn.
* `"GameEndState"` - string explaining how the game ended. Only valid after game is over. 
  * Format is: "{Winner} {Reason} {AdditionalContext}" Where *Winner* is stringified PlayerEnum, *Reason* is stringified [GameEndReason](https://github.com/ScriptsOfTribute/ScriptsOfTribute-Core/blob/c92f394483a9b2ba2fff0a52194bace6a4b7114d/Engine/src/Board/GameEndReason.cs#L3C13-L3C26). *AdditionalContent* is a string that can contain additional info.

* `"EnemyPlayer"` - *EnemyPlayer* object giving info about enemy status.
* `"CompletedActions"` - array of *CompletedActions*
* `"TavernCards"` - array of *Cards* that are in (whole) tavern.
* `"PendingChoice"` - *Choice* pending which bot has to handle.


## Examples of GameRunner use for external bots
To run GameRunner with our external langauge bot we have to modify bot argument format. 
Instead of providing bot's name like in case of C# Bots made with our engine user should use format `"cmd:<command>"`. For example "cmd:python example-bot.py" or "cmd:python3 example-bot.py" depending on what executable is registered in your terminal to run python programs. Remember about the quotes so that whole command line, with program and arguments is passed, without them name of the program will be lost.

Let's take for example [`example-bot.py`](Bots/ExternalLanguageBotsUtils/Python/example-bot.py). Let's clash him with [RandomBot](Bots/src/RandomBot.cs):
* `.\GameRunner.exe RandomBot "cmd:python example-bot.py" -n 1` 

it works as long as current terminal has `python` registered as name for the Python executable. In case it's `python3` like in some Linux OS
you want to use 
* `.\GameRunner.exe RandomBot "cmd:python3 example-bot.py" -n 1`

In case of executable files with bots case is similar. Let's say we compiled our C++ bot. We get some executable. All user has to type is:

* `.\GameRunner.exe RandomBot "cmd:.\MyCppBot" -n 1`
